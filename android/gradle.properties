# NOTE: The Gradle daemon in your log crashed running on Java 21 (Android Studio JBR).
# Some combinations of Gradle/AGP/JBR may be unstable on certain systems. The
# recommended quick fix is to point Gradle to a stable JDK 17 installation.
# Two ways to do this:
# 1) Install a JDK 17 (Eclipse Temurin / Adoptium / Azul) and set the system
#    environment variable JAVA_HOME to its install path before launching IDE/term.
# 2) Or pin Gradle to a specific JDK by uncommenting and editing the line below
#    to the absolute path of your JDK 17 installation. Example Windows path:
#    C:\\Program Files\\Java\\jdk-17.0.8
#
# To use option (2) add (uncomment) one of these lines and set the correct path:
# org.gradle.java.home=C:\\Program Files\\Java\\jdk-17
# org.gradle.java.home=C:\\Program Files\\Eclipse Adoptium\\jdk-17.0.8.1-hotspot

# If you prefer setting JAVA_HOME at OS level, make sure to restart your shell/IDE
# after changing it. After switching to JDK 17, run:
#   flutter clean; flutter pub get; flutter run -d <device>
